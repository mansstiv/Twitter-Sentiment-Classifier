# Twitter-Sentiment-Classifier
Developed multiple sentiment classifiers, experimenting with models (FFNN, LSTM, GRU, BERT) and word embeddings (TF-IDF, GloVe) for the Twitter dataset.

### Feed-Forward Neural Network Project Description

Develop a vaccine sentiment classifier with 3 classes (neutral, anti-vax and pro-vax) using
feed-forward neural networks and the datasets of the previous homework provided on eclass. We expect you to experiment with at least two models and compare them using
F1 score, recall and precision. For the development of the models, you are expected to
experiment at least with the following hyperparameters:

* the number of hidden layers and the number of their units
* the activation functions
* the loss function
* the optimizer

Furthermore, in at least one of your models, you must use pre-trained word embedding
vectors using GloVe. <br>
For your best model, you must also provide the loss vs epochs plot along with the ROC
curve (on the validation set, after training has been completed) and explain what you see.
